ATP5H and CDK13 have been linked to ATR inhibition in glioblastoma upon gene knockout. When ATP5H is knocked out, there is a decrease in glioblastoma growth and an increase in apoptosis. ATP5H is a subunit of mitochondrial ATP synthase, and its knockout leads to impaired mitochondrial function and increased oxidative stress, ultimately resulting in decreased tumor cell survival. Similarly, knockout of CDK13 has also been shown to inhibit glioblastoma growth by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. CDK13 is a cyclin-dependent kinase that plays a role in RNA splicing, and its inhibition leads to altered gene expression and impaired cell proliferation. Overall, the knockout of ATP5H and CDK13 have been shown to be effective in inhibiting glioblastoma growth through different mechanisms, highlighting their potential as therapeutic targets in the treatment of this aggressive brain tumor.
