Several genes have been linked to ATR inhibition in glioblastoma upon drug treatment, including POLE4, HIRA, ATM, RAD1, UBE2T, HUS1, WEE1, RAD9A, and ATRIP. In particular, the gene POLE4 has been shown to play a role in ATR inhibition in glioblastoma cells. A study found that inhibition of POLE4 reduced the viability of glioblastoma cells upon ATR inhibition, suggesting that POLE4 may be a potential therapeutic target for glioblastoma treatment. Similarly, HIRA has also been linked to ATR inhibition in glioblastoma. HIRA knockdown was shown to sensitize glioblastoma cells to ATR inhibition, indicating that targeting HIRA in combination with ATR inhibition could be a promising treatment strategy for glioblastoma patients. Additionally, ATM, a key player in the DNA damage response pathway, has been connected to ATR inhibition in glioblastoma. Inhibition of ATM was found to enhance the cytotoxic effects of ATR inhibition in glioblastoma cells, suggesting that targeting both ATM and ATR pathways could be a potential therapeutic approach for glioblastoma treatment. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the genetic mechanisms underlying ATR inhibition in glioblastoma for the development of novel treatment strategies.
