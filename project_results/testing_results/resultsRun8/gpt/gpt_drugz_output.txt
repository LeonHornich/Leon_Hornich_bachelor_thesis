ATR (ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3 related) is a key protein kinase involved in the DNA damage response, particularly in the replication stress response. In the context of glioblastoma, ATR inhibition can be a potential therapeutic strategy, especially in conjunction with other DNA-damaging therapies. Several genes have been linked to ATR inhibition, often by affecting DNA repair pathways or cell cycle checkpoints.

### RECQL4

RECQL4 is a member of the RecQ helicase family, which plays a crucial role in DNA repair. In the context of ATR inhibition, RECQL4 has been implicated in the response to DNA damage and replication stress. Studies have shown that cells deficient in RECQL4 are more sensitive to ATR inhibitors, suggesting that RECQL4 may be involved in pathways that repair or signal replication stress. This sensitivity could be leveraged in glioblastoma treatment, where targeting RECQL4-deficient tumor cells with ATR inhibitors could selectively kill cancer cells that rely heavily on RECQL4 for survival under replication stress conditions. The exact mechanisms through which RECQL4 interacts with ATR inhibition are still being elucidated, but they likely involve a combination of impaired fork stabilization and defective DNA repair processes.

### WEE1

WEE1 is a kinase that regulates the G2/M checkpoint by inhibiting CDK1 activity, allowing the cell time to repair DNA before mitosis. ATR inhibition in combination with WEE1 inhibition has been explored as a therapeutic strategy, particularly in glioblastoma. The rationale is that ATR inhibition exacerbates replication stress, leading to enhanced DNA damage, while WEE1 inhibition prevents the cell from arresting in G2/M to repair this damage, pushing the cell toward mitotic catastrophe. This combination can be particularly effective in tumor cells with defective p53, which already have impaired checkpoint control. In glioblastoma models, this dual inhibition has demonstrated increased apoptosis and reduced survival, making it a promising area of research for enhancing therapeutic efficacy against this aggressive cancer.

### RAD17

RAD17 is a key player in the DNA damage checkpoint signaling pathway. It is involved in the ATR-dependent activation of the checkpoint kinase CHK1, which helps stabilize replication forks and prevent premature entry into mitosis. In glioblastoma, inhibiting ATR signaling might sensitize cells to DNA-damaging agents by impairing the RAD17-mediated checkpoint control, thereby preventing the repair of DNA damage. The depletion or inhibition of RAD17, in conjunction with ATR inhibition, could lead to increased DNA damage and apoptosis in glioblastoma cells, potentially improving the effectiveness of treatments like radiotherapy or chemotherapy, which rely on inducing DNA damage to kill cancer cells. This strategy highlights the potential for synthetic lethality by targeting multiple nodes in the DNA damage response pathway.

These insights provide a foundation for novel therapeutic strategies in glioblastoma that leverage the interplay between ATR signaling and the roles of specific genes such as RECQL4, WEE1, and RAD17. Further studies are necessary to fully understand their interdependencies and to optimize combination treatments that could improve patient outcomes.
