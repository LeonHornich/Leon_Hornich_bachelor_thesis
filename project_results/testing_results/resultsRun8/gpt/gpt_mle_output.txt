Here are some genes from your list that have been linked to ATR inhibition in glioblastoma upon gene knockout:

1. **CDK2**: In glioblastoma, CDK2 (cyclin-dependent kinase 2) has been identified to play a crucial role in cell cycle regulation, particularly in the transition from G1 to S phase. Research has shown that the knockout of CDK2 can enhance the vulnerability of glioblastoma cells to ATR (ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein) inhibition. ATR is a pivotal protein involved in the DNA damage response and maintaining genomic stability. When CDK2 is depleted, there is a disruption in the normal progression of the cell cycle, leading to an increased dependency on ATR-mediated pathways for survival. Consequently, ATR inhibitors become more effective, often leading to increased DNA damage, apoptosis, and reduced proliferation in cancer cells, highlighting a potential therapeutic strategy in targeting CDK2 for enhancing ATR inhibitor efficacy in glioblastoma treatment.

2. **E2F7**: E2F7 is a member of the E2F family of transcription factors known to be involved in cell proliferation and DNA synthesis regulation. In glioblastoma, studies have demonstrated that E2F7 acts as an essential transcriptional repressor that can influence the expression of numerous genes involved in cell cycle regulation and DNA repair. Upon knockout of E2F7, glioblastoma cells show increased sensitivity to ATR inhibition. This increased sensitivity is attributed to the deregulation of DNA repair mechanisms and cell cycle checkpoints that result from the absence of E2F7. Without the repressive function of E2F7, cancer cells can accumulate DNA damage, making them more susceptible to ATR inhibitors. As a result, targeting E2F7 in conjunction with ATR inhibitors could be a promising therapeutic strategy to enhance the treatment outcomes for glioblastoma patients.

3. **USP38**: USP38 (Ubiquitin Specific Peptidase 38) has been implicated in various cellular processes, including the regulation of protein stability and degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Knockout studies of USP38 in glioblastoma models have suggested a potential role in modulating ATR pathway activity. The absence of USP38 leads to an accumulation of DNA damage and increased cellular stress, which makes tumor cells more reliant on ATR for survival and repair. Thus, ATR inhibitors tend to be more effective in USP38-deficient settings, as the protective mechanisms are compromised, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. This connection highlights USP38 as a potential biomarker for predicting responsiveness to ATR-targeted therapies and as a target for combination therapy strategies in glioblastoma.

4. **SMARCA5**: SMARCA5, also known as SNF2H, is a chromatin remodeler involved in various DNA repair and replication processes. Its role in reorganizing chromatin structure is vital for effective DNA damage response and maintaining genomic integrity. Knockout experiments in glioblastoma cells have shown that SMARCA5 deficiency increases the cells' reliance on ATR-mediated DNA damage response mechanisms. Loss of SMARCA5 function disrupts normal chromatin dynamics and DNA repair pathways, which can lead to an accumulation of DNA damage. Under these circumstances, glioblastoma cells become more dependent on ATR for survival. Hence, when ATR is inhibited, these cells experience exacerbated DNA damage, leading to increased cell death. This finding opens up the potential for using SMARCA5 inhibitors in combination with ATR inhibitors as a targeted therapy approach in glioblastoma.

These genes and their interactions with ATR inhibition highlight potential avenues for enhancing glioblastoma therapies by targeting specific dependencies that arise from gene knockouts.
