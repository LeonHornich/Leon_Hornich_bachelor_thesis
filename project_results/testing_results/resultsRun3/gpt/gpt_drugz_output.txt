Based on historical records, the gene ATM has shown to enhance drug activity upon CRISPR knockout. The ATM gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoint activation in response to DNA damage. Studies have shown that CRISPR knockout of ATM can sensitize cancer cells to certain chemotherapeutic drugs, making them more susceptible to treatment. This is likely due to the fact that ATM-deficient cells have impaired DNA repair mechanisms, leading to increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents. Therefore, targeting ATM with CRISPR technology could potentially be a promising strategy to enhance the efficacy of certain cancer treatments.

Another gene that has shown records of enhancing drug activity upon CRISPR knockout is WEE1. The WEE1 gene encodes a protein kinase that plays a key role in cell cycle regulation by inhibiting the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases. Inhibition of WEE1 has been shown to enhance the sensitivity of cancer cells to DNA-damaging agents, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy. CRISPR knockout of WEE1 can lead to increased replication stress and DNA damage, making cancer cells more vulnerable to genotoxic stress. Therefore, targeting WEE1 with CRISPR technology could potentially improve the effectiveness of certain cancer treatments by sensitizing cancer cells to DNA-damaging agents.

One more gene that has shown to enhance drug activity upon CRISPR knockout is KEAP1. The KEAP1 gene encodes a protein that regulates the antioxidant response by controlling the activity of the transcription factor NRF2. Inhibition of KEAP1 has been shown to activate the NRF2 pathway, leading to increased expression of antioxidant and cytoprotective genes. CRISPR knockout of KEAP1 can enhance the cellular antioxidant defense mechanism, protecting cells from oxidative damage and promoting cell survival. This could potentially impact the efficacy of certain drugs that induce oxidative stress or target the antioxidant pathways in cancer cells. Targeting KEAP1 with CRISPR technology could provide a novel approach to enhance the activity of certain drugs by modulating the cellular antioxidant response.
