Several studies have shown that knockout of the CDK2 gene leads to inhibition of glioblastoma growth. CDK2 is a cyclin-dependent kinase that plays a crucial role in cell cycle regulation and has been identified as a potential target for cancer therapy. Inhibiting CDK2 activity has been shown to induce cell cycle arrest and inhibit proliferation of cancer cells, including glioblastoma cells. Furthermore, CDK2 inhibition has been shown to enhance the effectiveness of other cancer therapies, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Overall, targeting CDK2 shows promise as a potential therapeutic strategy for treating glioblastoma.

On the other hand, knockout of the CDC25B gene has also been shown to inhibit glioblastoma. CDC25B is a phosphatase that regulates the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases, including CDK2. Inhibition of CDC25B has been shown to induce cell cycle arrest and inhibit proliferation of cancer cells, including glioblastoma cells. CDC25B has also been implicated in promoting tumor growth and metastasis in various cancers, making it a potential target for cancer therapy. Therefore, targeting CDC25B could be a promising strategy for treating glioblastoma.

Additionally, knockout of the ELP3 gene has been shown to inhibit glioblastoma growth. ELP3 is a subunit of the Elongator complex, which is involved in RNA polymerase II transcription and tRNA modification. Inhibition of ELP3 has been shown to induce apoptosis and inhibit proliferation of cancer cells, including glioblastoma cells. ELP3 has also been implicated in promoting the growth and metastasis of various cancers, making it a potential target for cancer therapy. Targeting ELP3 could therefore be a promising approach for treating glioblastoma.
