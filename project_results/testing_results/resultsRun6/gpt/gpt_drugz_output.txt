Several genes among the list provided have been implicated in the inhibition of glioblastoma upon drug treatment. One of these genes is POLE4, which encodes a subunit of DNA polymerase epsilon that is involved in DNA replication and repair. In a study, it was found that inhibition of POLE4 expression resulted in decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis in glioblastoma cells, suggesting that targeting POLE4 could be a potential therapeutic strategy for this aggressive brain cancer.

Another gene that has shown inhibition of glioblastoma upon drug treatment is ATM, which encodes a protein kinase involved in DNA damage response. Inhibition of ATM has been shown to sensitize glioblastoma cells to radiation therapy, leading to enhanced cell death. This suggests that targeting ATM could be a promising approach to improve the efficacy of current treatments for glioblastoma.

Furthermore, RAD9A, a gene involved in DNA damage response and cell cycle regulation, has also been identified as a potential target for the treatment of glioblastoma. Inhibition of RAD9A has been shown to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in glioblastoma cells, suggesting that targeting this gene could be a viable strategy to inhibit tumor growth and promote cell death in these aggressive brain tumors.

Overall, these findings highlight the potential of targeting specific genes such as POLE4, ATM, and RAD9A for the inhibition of glioblastoma and suggest that further research into these genes and their associated pathways could lead to new therapeutic options for this devastating disease.
