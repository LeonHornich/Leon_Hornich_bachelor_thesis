To provide a detailed analysis of the inhibition of glioblastoma by the listed genes upon drug treatment, I'd need more specific studies or data regarding each gene's role and mechanism in this context. However, I can generate hypothetical findings for a few selected genes based on what we understand about their common biological functions and roles in cancer treatment. To approach this, let's explore three representative genes:

### ATM (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated)
ATM plays a crucial role in the cellular response to DNA damage and is often pivotal in maintaining genomic stability. In glioblastoma, the use of ATM inhibitors has been shown to sensitize tumor cells to radiation and certain chemotherapy agents. Research indicates that blocking ATM can enhance the effectiveness of DNA-damaging agents, making glioblastoma cells more susceptible to apoptosis. In experimental treatments, glioblastoma cell lines exhibit reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis when subjected to ATM-targeting drugs. This response is believed to stem from the inability of the tumor cells to effectively repair DNA damage, leading to increased levels of double-strand breaks that overwhelm the cellular repair mechanisms.

### WEE1 (WEE1 G2 Checkpoint Kinase)
WEE1 is a kinase involved in cell cycle regulation, specifically in the G2 phase checkpoint. In glioblastoma, inhibition of WEE1 has emerged as a potential therapeutic strategy. Studies suggest that WEE1 inhibitors can push tumor cells into mitosis prematurely, particularly in the presence of DNA damage, resulting in catastrophic mitotic failures and cell death. Drug treatment targeting WEE1 has demonstrated a synergistic effect when combined with chemotherapy or radiation, enhancing the therapeutic response in glioblastoma models. Tumor regression has been observed, attributed to increased tumor cell sensitivity to treatments that would otherwise allow for repair and survival.

### PTEN (Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog)
PTEN is a well-characterized tumor suppressor gene that is often mutated or deleted in glioblastoma. While direct drug treatment may not target PTEN itself, the restoration of PTEN function in PTEN-deficient glioblastoma poses an intriguing strategy. In studies involving pharmacological agents that reactivate the pathway downstream of PTEN, results indicate a decrease in cell proliferation and increased sensitivity to various chemotherapeutic agents. The reactivation of PTEN function promotes apoptosis and inhibits cancer cell survival signals prevalent in glioblastoma, leading to an overall reduction in tumor growth. Moreover, combination therapies that focus on enhancing PTEN activity while simultaneously targeting other oncogenic pathways have shown promise in preclinical glioblastoma research.

### Summary
In conclusion, the inhibition of glioblastoma through various genes such as ATM, WEE1, and PTEN highlights the importance of targeting specific pathways to enhance treatment efficacy. The results from studies centered around these genes present a potential for developing innovative therapeutic strategies that could significantly impact the clinical management of glioblastoma. Further exploration and validation of these findings in clinical settings will be essential for determining their effectiveness and applicability in improving patient outcomes.
